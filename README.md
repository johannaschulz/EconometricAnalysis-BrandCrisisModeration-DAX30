# EconometricAnalysis-BrandCrisisModeration-DAX30
Master Thesis project including descriptive analysis, time series plotting, econometric analysis.

This master's thesis project involves a detailed analysis of the moderating effects of brand strength on the financial market value of companies during economic crises, with a particular focus on the COVID-19 pandemic period. The project employs a range of analytical techniques to develop a nuanced understanding of how strong brands can influence a company's resilience during turbulent economic times.

## Main components of the project:
### Descriptive analysis:
The project begins with a thorough descriptive analysis of the dataset, which includes the monthly stock prices of the 30 DAX-listed companies from the beginning of 2019 to the end of 2020. This section lays the foundation by providing insights into fundamental trends, patterns and characteristics of the data.
### Time series presentation:
Time series visualizations are carried out to visualize the dynamics over time. These plots not only illustrate stock price movements over time, but also highlight key periods of economic change and volatility, particularly emphasizing the occurrence and progression of the COVID-19 crisis.
### Econometric analysis - fixed effects regression:
The centerpiece of the project is a econometric analysis using multiple regression models. With these models, six hypotheses of the author are tested.
### Moderation analysis via interaction terms:
An important feature of this analysis is the use of interaction terms between brand presence and brand strength and economic indicators (Crisis Dummy and CPI change). This method provides a deeper understanding of how the presence of a strong brand mitigates the impact of economic downturns on the market value of companies.
### Robustness checks and sensitivity analyses:
To ensure the reliability of the results, the project includes robustness checks. Sensitivity analyses are conducted to test the stability of the results under different assumptions and conditions.

## Objective:
The main objective of this paper is to contribute to the understanding of brand equity as a significant factor in the financial stability of companies during economic crises. By combining data analysis with advanced econometric methods, this project aims to provide valuable insights for academics, industry practitioners and policy makers interested in the intersection of branding, finance and economic uncertainty.
